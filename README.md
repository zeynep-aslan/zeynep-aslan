<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Zeynep</h1>


I'm a 22 years old Machine Learning enthusiast based in Istanbul. I'm pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Engineering while working as a data scientist at Enerjisa Üretim. In the past, I worked as a Computer Vision Engineer for 7 months, working in various problems. Currently you'll find me learning natural language processing, doing time series forecasting and maybe releasing tutorials about several computer vision concepts.
